# My first page

## Description

This is my first website made to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.<br>
The **BEM** convention and **normalize.css** were used. In JavaScript code I used **arrow functions**.<br>
I invite you to familiarize yourself with my work.

## What can you find here and how it's working

I've posted here the solutions to the webdev course.<br>
There are two buttons on the page. One changes the color of the header. The second changes the background color.<br>
Have a fun! ðŸ˜‰
