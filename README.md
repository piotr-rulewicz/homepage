# My first page

## Description

This is my first website made to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
The **BEM** convention and **normalize.css** were used. In JavaScript code I used **arrow functions**.
I invite you to familiarize yourself with my work.

## What can you find here and how it's working

I've posted here the solutions to the webdev course.
There are two buttons on the page. One changes the color of the header. The second changes the background color.
Have a fun! ðŸ˜‰
